###  About This Repository

> This repository is my personal chronicle of tackling programming challenges on LeetCode. It serves as a practical exercise and a living document of my journey in competitive programming, primarily for interview preparation and to deepen my understanding of core computer science concepts.

My approach focuses on:
* **Clarity and Readability:** Writing clean, well-commented code that is easy to understand.
* **Optimal Solutions:** Striving not just for a correct answer, but for the most efficient one in terms of time and space complexity.
* **Conceptual Understanding:** Each solution is an opportunity to explore and solidify my knowledge of data structures and algorithms.
